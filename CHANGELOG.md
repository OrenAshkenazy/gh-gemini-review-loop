## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.43] - 2026-08-17

Three of the four token/latency issues landed here at once. #88 and #89 were
merged into their stacked base branches rather than into `main`, so their
content reached `main` only when #90 (the stack tip) was merged — see the note
under 0.2.41/0.2.42.

### Changed

- **Skill loads on demand instead of all at once.** `SKILL.md` split from 1,195
  lines to 242, with the deeper material moved to seven `references/*.md` files
  the agent opens only when a run needs them (sweep internals, judge eval,
  receipts, terminal report, resume/recovery, variations, script usage). Worst
  case — every reference opened — is still smaller than the previous
  unconditional load. Closes #84.
- **Reviewer waits cost O(1) agent turns.** A blocking `--wait` run as a
  background task is now the primary mode; the chunked fallback decays 60s →
  300s instead of 60s → 90s. A 30-minute reviewer wait costs 2 turns
  (background) or 7 (fallback) instead of 21. Adds a 60s stderr heartbeat for
  liveness and a typed `WaitTimedOut` so a timeout ends in a relayable block
  rather than a traceback. Closes #85.
- **One receipt, one channel.** The full receipt is written to the sticky PR
  comment (`RUNNING` / `DONE` / `STOPPED`, edited in place) and chat gets a
  single `[loop]` pointer line — roughly 1,700 characters per cycle down to
  ~230. The HARD-GATE verbatim reprint and the push-gate state snapshot are
  gone; the Stop-hook backstop is unchanged. If the comment write fails, or
  under `--dry-run`, the full receipt still prints to stdout, so a receipt is
  never lost. Closes #86.

### Fixed

- The compact receipt line mixed two populations: `findings_fetched` is
  cumulative for the run, but the new/carried split describes only the
  currently-open findings, so a cycle that resolved earlier findings could read
  `findings 4 (1 new, 0 carried over)`, and a clean terminal run
  `findings 4 (0 new, 0 carried over)`. The cumulative count is now labelled
  "seen this run" and the split rides on `open`, where it shares a denominator;
  it is dropped entirely if the counts do not account for the open set.
- Terminal receipts lost their carried-over classification: `--record-run`
  called `clear_run_tracking()` before `prior_finding_fingerprints()` read the
  run block it had just deleted, so every still-open finding on a capped,
  human, or stopped receipt rendered as new. The fingerprints are now captured
  before the terminal branch.

## [0.2.42] - 2026-08-17

No functional change. Release automation fires on PR merge, and #89 was merged
into its stacked base branch rather than into `main`, so this tag is a version
bump over unchanged content. The work it is named for shipped in 0.2.43.

## [0.2.41] - 2026-08-17

No functional change, for the same reason as 0.2.42 (#88 merged into its base
branch). The work it is named for shipped in 0.2.43.

## [0.2.40] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **Hooks stop paying for an idle session.** The three bundled hooks are now
  shell guards that exit before spawning Python unless a `loop-active` sentinel
  exists and is younger than a 24h TTL. Measured on an idle session, the two
  PreToolUse gates went from ~277ms to ~12ms per tool call. The gates import a
  new stdlib-only `loop_state.py` rather than the 3,800-line main script, so the
  active path got faster too. `statusMessage` removed from all three hooks — an
  idle session no longer flashes loop status. Closes #83.

### Fixed

- `touch_sentinel()` swallowed `OSError` while its comment claimed the hooks
  would degrade to always spawning Python. The shell guard does the opposite:
  an absent sentinel exits 0, so a run active in `state.json` would silently
  lose its edit gate, push gate and Stop backstop. It now returns `False` on
  failure and the caller warns, naming the guarantees that go quiet. Failing
  open for the loop itself is kept deliberately — a marker that cannot be
  written must never wedge a run.

### Fixed

- Sibling sweeps now fingerprint a single flagged multi-line range and search
  only the PR's changed files for exact normalized copies. These hits are
  reported as `mirror` candidates, distinct from token-intersection matches.
  Closes #77.
- Mirror normalization now respects language-specific comment syntax, preserves
  string contents and Python indentation, and excludes copies overlapping any
  already-flagged line.
- Shape clustering now reads every code line in a reviewer's anchored range,
  with single-line fallback for reviewers that omit range starts. Token-based
  clustering and sibling sweeps require identifier-like shared tokens, so
  punctuation such as `!` and `&&` still constrains matches without making a
  pattern sweepable. Closes #74, #75, and #76.
- Degenerate review clustering now emits an explicit advisory when three or
  more findings all become singleton patterns, making prose-hash fallback
  failures visible before fixes begin in both Markdown and structured JSON
  output and in automatic snapshots. Shape clustering now reads source only
  when the current checkout matches the selected PR repository and head. The
  skill documents a safe manual recovery scoped to the explicitly selected PR.
  Closes #73.

### Changed

- Span-clustering and duplicate-block sweep regressions now use small,
  repository-owned synthetic corpora.
- **Bulletproof judge eval.** The `--judge-mode` path no longer depends on the `openai` SDK or on `OPENAI_API_KEY` being exported in a shell rc file — the two failure modes that wasted the most setup time (broken Homebrew Python, GUI-launched Claude Code not inheriting `~/.zshenv`, `pip install openai` blocked by externally-managed-environment).
  - `judge.py` now POSTs to `chat.completions` via stdlib `urllib`. Zero install step; works on any Python 3.10+. Self-hosted gateways still work via `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. HTTP error bodies surface verbatim so 401s show "Incorrect API key" instead of a generic message.
  - New `key_resolver.py` with tiered key lookup: env var → `~/.config/gh-gemini-review-loop/.env` (chmod 600) → macOS Keychain → Linux `secret-tool`. New CLI: `--set` (interactive or `--from-stdin`), `--print-source` (redacted), `--clear`. Storage default is the OS keystore — keys never sit in shell rc files or `ps` output.
  - `judge_doctor.py` updated: the `[2/5] openai SDK` check is replaced by `[2/5] network reachability` (a TCP probe to `api.openai.com:443`, no key needed). The `[3/5]` key check uses the tiered resolver and reports which source produced the key.
  - README + SKILL.md rewrite the "Setting your `OPENAI_API_KEY`" section around `key_resolver.py --set` as the recommended path. The env-var path stays documented as the escape hatch for CI / power users. Closes #23.

### Added

- **Persistent configurable re-review cap.** End users can set `max_rereview_requests` in `~/.config/gh-gemini-review-loop/preferences.json`; `--max-rereview-requests` still overrides it for one manual invocation. Defaults remain 3 cycles.
- **Optional end-user OpenAI judge (`--judge-mode`).** Per-finding labels (`valid_actionable` / `false_positive` / `needs_human` / `explanation_only` / `duplicate` / `already_addressed` + `severity_override` + `recommended_action`) so users can quickly see what's worth fixing on their own PRs. Default mode is `off` — nothing is sent to OpenAI until the user opts in. The script (`fetch_gemini_threads.py`) is the single source of truth: it reads `~/.config/gh-gemini-review-loop/preferences.json` on every invocation and combines that with the `--judge-phase {cycle,complete}` the agent supplies. New flags: `--judge-mode {off,on_cycle,on_complete,once}`, `--judge-phase`, `--judge-model`. New file: `plugins/.../scripts/judge.py` (ships in the install). Judge is read-only — it never resolves threads, posts comments, or pushes. Graceful skip when `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `openai` SDK missing, with a structured `{"status":"skipped","skip_reason":"..."}` in the JSON output. Privacy boundary documented in README + SKILL.md.
- **Maintainer-side Layer B finding-quality eval.** Cross-vendor LLM-as-judge (OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` by default) rates each Gemini Code Assist finding as `useful` / `false-positive` / `borderline` / `dup` and compares against a hand-labeled corpus. Initial corpus: 11 findings from this repo's own PRs (#6–#9), ~91% useful by hand-label.
  - Maintainer side: `evals/` directory (judge, runner, fixtures, 32 hermetic tests, README).
  - Reporting: weekly CI workflow (`.github/workflows/eval-weekly.yml`) can commit a rendered report to `evals/results/latest.md` + `evals/results/YYYY-QQ.md` (per-quarter history) and update a rolling per-quarter tracking Issue for maintainer notifications.
  - Public README calibration copy is intentionally deferred until the reporting path is ready. End-user installs never ship the maintainer eval or call OpenAI for this maintainer-side workflow.
  - All cycle-3 hardening from the original PR #13 stack already baked in: API try/except → JudgeError, `--samples` validation, `request_timeout` (30s default), per-finding JudgeError tolerance, `majority_judge_label` empty-safe, explicit utf-8 I/O, `--report` parent dir, structured skip when key/SDK missing.

### Changed

- **Listing readiness pass for claudemarketplaces.com.** Added per-plugin `author` field (with email) to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and the plugin's own `plugin.json`. README restructured around the solo-builder / small-team workflow: prerequisites, two-step install, natural-language usage examples, "Why This Plugin", optional judge eval, configuration, and advanced manual invocation. Removed stale top-of-repo `SKILL.md` and `scripts/` artifacts left over from the P2 plugin restructure — they were local-only (never tracked in git) but could confuse a fresh `git clone`.
- **Sharpened `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata for claudemarketplaces.com indexing.** Marketplace-level and plugin-level descriptions now position the plugin for solo builders and small teams using Claude Code, while retaining the technical differentiators: thread-state awareness, severity filtering, hard 3-cycle cap, stale/addressed-by-reply handling, and sticky receipts. `tags` expanded to 7 (added `sticky-receipt`, `severity-aware`). `keywords` expanded to 9 (added `sticky-receipt`, `severity-aware`, `addressed-by-reply`, `auto-resolve`, `dry-run`) to improve hit-rate against search queries.

### Added

- **Sticky receipt** (`--sticky-receipt`). Maintains one comment per PR that the script edits in place across loop invocations, instead of accreting a new comment per cycle. State persists in `~/.config/gh-gemini-review-loop/state.json` (override with `GGRL_STATE_DIR`). Discovery fallback: if the local state file is missing, the script scans PR comments for an embedded marker and re-attaches to the existing receipt. New `--receipt-status {running,done,stopped}` flag tags the header so PR watchers can see loop phase at a glance. Pairs with the in-chat Progress Narration for end users who want visibility outside the terminal.
- **Release automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). On every PR merge to `main`, the workflow bumps `plugins/gh-gemini-review-loop/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` per the PR's `release:major` / `release:minor` / `release:patch` label (default patch, opt-out via `release:skip`), tags the commit, and creates a GitHub Release whose body is the merged PR's description verbatim. Aborts cleanly if the target tag already exists. Sibling workflow `setup-labels.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch`) creates the four `release:*` labels in fresh forks.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** documents the label semantics, release-notes flow (PR body → GitHub Release body), local lint/test commands, and the stacked-PR footgun we hit earlier.
- **Progress Narration** section in SKILL.md. Requires the agent to emit one-line status updates (`[loop] cycle N/3 — <phase>`) at each phase transition during the loop. No code change — pure agent-instruction layer. Eliminates the "silent loop feels broken" UX problem in interactive sessions.
- `--min-severity {critical,high,medium,low}` flag and `filter_by_min_severity()` helper. Drops actionable threads below the chosen severity. By default, threads with no Gemini priority marker (`unknown`) are kept; pass `--drop-unknown-severity` to remove them too.
- `filter_by_min_severity` now accepts `min_severity=None`, enabling `--drop-unknown-severity` to be used independently of `--min-severity` (closes a silent no-op).
- **Variations** section in SKILL.md mapping common user phrasings ("only fix high severity", "audit-only run", "be persistent") to the right script flag combinations. Makes agent dispatch deterministic.
- 8 new pytest cases for `filter_by_min_severity` (covering each severity threshold, unknown handling, stability, empty input). Test count: 36 → 44.

### Changed

- README rewritten around the solo-builder / small-team workflow, with install and natural-language usage up front and configuration details moved lower in the document.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-24

First publishable release. Packaged as a Claude Code plugin marketplace.

### Added

- **Plugin packaging.** Repo is now a single-plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `plugins/gh-gemini-review-loop/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Install via `/plugin marketplace add OrenAshkenazy/gh-gemini-review-loop` then `/plugin install gh-gemini-review-loop@gh-gemini-review-loop`.
- `ADDRESSED_BY_REPLY` detection and auto-resolution. Unresolved threads where a non-bot maintainer posted a substantive (≥30 char) reply are treated as deliberate deferrals; the loop never re-attempts those fixes and resolves the threads via GraphQL on the next pass.
- `--dry-run` flag. All GraphQL mutations (`resolveReviewThread`, `gh pr comment` for receipts) route through a single choke point that logs intended writes to stderr instead of executing.
- Pagination guard. Warns when `reviewThreads` / `reviews` / PR comments hit the 100-item page limit or when per-thread comments hit 50, surfacing silent data loss on large PRs.
- Severity-aware ordering. Parses Gemini's priority image markers (`critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low`) and orders actionable threads with critical first.
- Agent-scoped cycle counter. Auto-detects the agent's GitHub login via `gh api user` and only counts re-review requests posted by that login toward the 3-cycle cap. Humans pinging Gemini no longer consume cycles. Override with `--agent-login NAME`, opt out with `--no-agent-filter`.
- `--post-receipt` flag. Posts a one-comment audit trail to the PR: cycles used, threads resolved, threads pending, severity breakdown.
- Pytest suite (36 tests) covering all pure functions: `parse_pr_url`, `is_addressed_by_reply`, `filter_threads`, `thread_severity`, `sort_by_severity`, `severity_counts`, `rereview_requests`, `pagination_warnings`, `thread_fingerprint`, `render_receipt`.
- GitHub Actions CI: ruff + py_compile + pytest on Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12.
- MIT LICENSE.

### Changed

- `--ignore-loop-limit` renamed to `--resolve-past-cap` (old name was misleading; only re-enabled resolution past the cap, didn't ignore the cap entirely). Old flag retained as a hidden deprecated alias.
- SKILL.md description tightened from ~440 chars to ~270 chars while preserving trigger phrases.
- Script path in SKILL.md uses `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/...` so the same skill works under both plugin install and legacy `~/.claude/skills/` install.

### Fixed

- Markdown renderer now displays the addressed-by-reply count alongside outdated and actionable counts.
