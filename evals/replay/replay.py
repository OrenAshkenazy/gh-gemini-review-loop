"""Deterministic replay of the sibling sweep over captured reviewer payloads.

Runs the real clusterer and the real sweep against reviewer findings captured
from PR #67, plus the reviewed source vendored beside them. No network, no
arguments, stdlib only — the output depends on nothing but this repository.

    python3 evals/replay/replay.py

Each fixture is clustered twice: once without a root (prose only, the pre-#69
behaviour) and once with the fixture's source directory as root (the shipping
behaviour, which also merges clusters whose findings anchor to the same code
shape). Any cluster reaching two sites is then swept for unflagged siblings.
