"""End-user-side LLM-as-judge for Gemini Code Assist findings.

This module ships INSIDE the installed plugin (it is what the user invokes
via ``--judge-mode``). It is intentionally separate from ``evals/judge.py``
at the repo root — that one is the maintainer's calibration judge and uses
a simpler 4-label schema. This one uses the richer end-user schema and runs
on the user's own PRs.

Verdict schema (richer than the maintainer one because end-users need
actionable advice, not just calibration labels):

- ``valid_actionable``   — Real finding the user should act on.
- ``false_positive``     — Incorrect; misread the diff or wrong context.
- ``needs_human``        — Requires a product/design/security judgment.
- ``explanation_only``   — Asks for an explanation, not a code change.
- ``duplicate``          — Substantively duplicates another finding on this PR.
- ``already_addressed``  — Resolved elsewhere; the line just hasn't been auto-resolved.

Plus:
- ``severity_override``  — One of critical/high/medium/low/none. Judge's
  opinion on the right severity, which can differ from Gemini's label.
- ``recommended_action`` — fix / reply / ignore / escalate.

Privacy / cost / safety invariants
- This module makes ZERO calls to OpenAI on its own. It only does work
  when the caller passes a judge mode and a phase that match. The caller
  (fetch_gemini_threads.py) reads the user's saved preference file and
  decides; this module obeys.
- The judge NEVER mutates the GitHub state. It cannot resolve, comment,
  push, or call any GraphQL/REST write. It only reads finding text and
  emits structured verdicts.
- When the OpenAI key is missing, this module returns a structured
  ``skipped`` result with a reason — not a raw exception. The caller
  surfaces the reason and continues the loop unchanged.
- The HTTP call uses stdlib ``urllib`` only (no ``openai`` SDK). Avoids
  the install-fragility class of failures (broken interpreters, pipx
  breakage, externally-managed envs). Trade-off: we re-implement one
  endpoint's request shape; we don't get streaming, retries with
  Retry-After, or vision. Acceptable for a single-shot JSON judge call.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert code-review judge. The user is deciding whether to act on \
a Gemini Code Assist finding on their pull request. Be strict: do not assume \
Gemini is correct just because it sounds confident, and do not assume it is \
wrong just because the finding is minor.

Classify the finding as exactly ONE verdict:
- "valid_actionable": Real issue the user should act on (bug, security, \
correctness, meaningful style/clarity improvement, missing test, doc/code \
mismatch, defensive null-safety on a plausible path).
- "false_positive": Incorrect — based on misreading the diff, looking at \
the wrong context, or claiming a problem that doesn't exist.
- "needs_human": Real but requires a product / design / security judgment \
the user must make. Don't auto-fix.
- "explanation_only": Asks for an explanation or context rather than a \
code change. Reply, don't edit.
- "duplicate": Substantively duplicates another finding on the same PR \
(e.g., re-flag at a slightly different line after a fix elsewhere).
- "already_addressed": The concern is resolved elsewhere in the diff; \
the line just hasn't been auto-resolved on GitHub.

Also output:
- "severity_override": Your opinion on the right severity (critical / high \
/ medium / low / none). Can match or differ from Gemini's label. "none" \
means below the threshold worth surfacing.
- "recommended_action": fix / reply / ignore / escalate.

Respond with strict JSON only, no preamble:
