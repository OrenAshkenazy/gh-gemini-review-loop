"""Slim loop-state helpers shared by the hook gates and the main script.

The PreToolUse/Stop hooks must decide "is a review loop active?" on every
matching tool call, so this module keeps that decision cheap: stdlib-only
imports, no GraphQL machinery, no argparse tree. Importing it costs
milliseconds where importing ``fetch_gemini_threads`` costs ~100ms.

It also owns the loop-active *sentinel file*: an empty marker whose existence
lets the hooks.json shell guard skip spawning Python entirely on the idle
path. Lifecycle:

- ``touch_sentinel()`` on every real fetch (loop start / each cycle). It
  returns False when the marker could not be written — which disables the
  gates for the run, so callers warn instead of ignoring it.
- ``clear_sentinel()`` when the terminal ``--record-run`` leaves no active
  run behind.
- A sentinel older than ``SENTINEL_TTL_SECONDS`` (24h) is stale — a crashed
  or abandoned loop must not keep the hooks live forever. The shell guard
  only checks existence (`[ -f ]`, the cheapest possible test — #103); the
  Python gates it spawns call ``reap_stale_sentinel()`` to delete a stale
  marker and stand down, so staleness costs nothing on the idle path.
