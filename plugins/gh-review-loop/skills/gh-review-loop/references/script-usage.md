# Script usage catalog

Resolve `$GGRL_PLUGIN_ROOT` first (see SKILL.md — run as its own Bash call). All commands below assume it is exported.

```bash
# Default fetch: resolves unresolved outdated reviewer threads AND
# addressed-by-reply threads (substantive non-bot reply, >=30 chars) before
# printing current feedback. The re-review cap does not block this cleanup.
# Delta mode: threads unchanged since the previous cycle collapse to one line;
# any change (new reply, edited body, moved anchor) renders full. The output
# ends with the profile-intro + planned-verification blocks (relay from here).
python3 "$GGRL_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/gh-review-loop/scripts/fetch_gemini_threads.py"

# Full render, ignoring the delta baseline. Use once after a resumed session
# or context compaction to re-establish the baseline; diff hunks keep the
# standard truncation cap.
python3 "$GGRL_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/gh-review-loop/scripts/fetch_gemini_threads.py" --full

# Wait for configured reviewer activity to appear (cycle 1 / initial review).
# No --after → returns as soon as activity is present; it does NOT wait for a
# quiet/settle period — at the initial review there either are comments or
# there aren't.
python3 "$GGRL_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/gh-review-loop/scripts/fetch_gemini_threads.py" --wait

# Wait for a NEW reviewer response after a re-review request (cycle 2+).
# Pass the re-review comment timestamp so prior-cycle activity is ignored.
# WITH --after the wait settles (waits for the new review to stabilize) so a
# fast-forward fetch doesn't catch a half-posted re-review.
# PRIMARY USE: run this as a BACKGROUND Bash task on runtimes with task
# completion notifications (Claude Code) — one turn per wait. It writes a
# one-line liveness heartbeat to stderr every ~60s; refusals and timeouts end
# the captured output with a deterministic relayable block (exit 0).
python3 "$GGRL_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/gh-review-loop/scripts/fetch_gemini_threads.py" \
    --wait --after "$REREVIEW_AT" --timeout 1800

# Chunked wait (fallback for runtimes without background-task completion
# notifications, e.g. Codex): return within the chunk with a deterministic
# status instead of blocking. Relay the one-line heartbeat verbatim, then run
# the next chunk with the suggested next_wait_seconds (60s, then 300s, then 900s).
python3 "$GGRL_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/gh-review-loop/scripts/fetch_gemini_threads.py" \
    --wait --after "$REREVIEW_AT" --wait-chunk-seconds 60

# After a --format json chunk, render the human heartbeat for relay:
python3 "$GGRL_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/gh-review-loop/scripts/fetch_gemini_threads.py" \
    --wait-heartbeat

# Request reviewer re-review via the script-owned helper.
# Parse JSON stdout and capture `created_at` as REREVIEW_AT.

# Render deterministic human-readable formatter blocks for relay.
# NOTE: the default fetch already appends both blocks to its output (and JSON
# fetches carry them as humanBlocks.profileIntro/.plannedVerification), so on a
# repo that already has a profile these standalone forms are out-of-band only.
# They ARE part of the first-run cycle: with no profile saved, the fetch emits
# a regenerate notice instead of the blocks (humanBlocks.profileBlocksProvisional
# is true, plannedVerification is empty), because the profile decision lands
# after that fetch. Save the profile, then run these two to get the real blocks.

The script emits `warning: ... hit page limit ...` to stderr if any GraphQL page maxes out (review threads, reviews, PR comments, or comments within a thread) — older items may be silently missing.

# Wait outcome handling (both modes)
# Statuses: waiting, settling, ready (same call returns the threads),
# timed_out, refused.
# - refused, kind: withdrawn -> terminal: record --outcome human --gemini-unconfirmed.
# - refused, kind: quota_exhausted -> ask the user now (stop the loop, or
#   upgrade/add credits then re-run the same wait); do NOT re-request the review.
# - timed_out -> record --gemini-unconfirmed; do not guess clean. Say the wait
#   timed out — never invent feedback.
