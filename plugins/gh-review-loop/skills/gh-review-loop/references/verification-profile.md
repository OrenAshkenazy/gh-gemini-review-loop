# Verification profile detail

Load this on a first run for a repo (no saved profile — the edit gate will name this moment), or when the user asks to customize, un-skip, or re-detect a profile. The every-cycle path (relay planned-verification block, run `run_profile.py`, feed `--verification`) is in SKILL.md.

Profiles are stored in `~/.config/gh-review-loop/preferences.json` under `profiles["owner/repo"]`.

## First-run flow (before the first fix attempt)

A `PreToolUse` hook blocks edits until a profile decision is saved. After fetching findings, before any edit:

1. Run `detect_profile.py <repo_root>` → `{stack, confidence, reasons, candidate_checks, presets}`. `presets` is the code-built option list — do not hand-roll the menu.
2. `stack == "unknown"` → do not prompt, but still **record the decision**: `judge.save_profile(repo, source="skipped", detected_stack="unknown")`, then use ad-hoc verification. The marker is what distinguishes "decided: ad hoc" from "not decided yet" — without it the edit gate never clears and every later fetch re-reports a first run.
3. Reconcile against repo docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `README`). If docs pin a non-standard invocation, surface it as a note beside the menu; never auto-persist an absolute path from prose.
4. Prompt once, using each `presets[i].label` verbatim as an option.
5. Persist via `judge.save_profile(...)`: `customize == true` → free-form customize path, `source="customized"`; otherwise persist `preset["checks"]` with `source=preset["source"]`. Every persisted check is `required: true`.
6. The fetch that preceded this decision could not describe a profile that did not exist, so it emitted a regenerate notice instead of the usual blocks (`humanBlocks.profileBlocksProvisional: true`, empty `plannedVerification`). Do not relay that notice as the intro — regenerate both blocks from the saved profile with `--profile-intro --repo <owner/repo>` and `--planned-verification --repo <owner/repo>`, and relay those.

## Gate semantics

Verify fails iff any `required` check fails or times out. Route all verification through `run_profile.py` when a profile is confirmed — never call the test runner directly; the runner times checks, captures structured output, and sets the exit code. On `skipped`/unknown profiles, relay the fallback intro and use ad-hoc narrowest-meaningful checks.

## Customizing / un-skipping

`skipped` suppresses automatic prompts only. Explicit user intent overrides: "add mypy to the checks" → `save_profile(..., source="customized")`; "set up a verification profile" → re-run detect → menu → save even over a `skipped` marker.
